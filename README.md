Vehicle Fleet Inventory Analysis
Part 1: Data Preparation
In Part 1, I transformed the raw data into a clean and structured format suitable for analysis. This involved:

Converting the CSV file to XLSX format.
Adjusting column widths for better visibility.
Removing empty rows and duplicate records.
Correcting spelling errors and removing whitespace.
Consolidating department names into a single column.
Part 2: Data Analysis
With the data cleaned and prepared, I proceeded to conduct comprehensive analysis using Excel's features:

Formatted the data as a table for easier management.
Calculated summary statistics including SUM, AVERAGE, MIN, MAX, and COUNT.
Created pivot tables to analyze equipment counts by department.
Sorted pivot table data for better visualization.
Generated additional pivot tables for detailed analysis, including breakdowns by equipment class.
This approach allowed for a thorough examination of the government fleet inventory, showcasing proficiency in data wrangling and analysis techniques in Excel.
